## Motivation

This project was motivated by Horiseon's need to improve their website to become more visible to prospective customers when searching for their type of service on the web. 

The product owners also wanted their CSS to be refactored to make it cleaner and easier to maintain in the future. 

## Problem Solved

The website was initially developed using `<div>` tags to define its structure. This reduced the ability for accessibility tools to assist their users in navigating the page. The site has been refactored to use semantic tags such as `<section>` and `<main>` as well as adding `alt` attributes and descriptions to all images on the site.

Numerous repeated CSS rules have been factored out to keep the code DRY.

## What I Learned
As a result of this project, I have learned the benefits of using HTML semantic tags for improving SEO and why they are necessary for those with accessibility needs.
